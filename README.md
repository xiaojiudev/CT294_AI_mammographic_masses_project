* count field: The number of non-null values.
* mean (Average): The average from all the values of that attribute and dividing by the count of non-null values.
* std (Standard Deviation): The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the data. It tells how much individual data points deviate from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean, while a lower standard deviation suggests that the data points are closer to the mean.
* min: The smallest value in the dataset
* 25%: 
* 50%:
* 75%:
* max: The largest value in the dataset
